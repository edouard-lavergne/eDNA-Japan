# Diversity analyses in this script follow "Numerical Ecology with R"
# by Daniel Borcard, Francois Gillet and Pierre Legendre

# All analyses presented in the manuscript can be found in this script
# Four data tables (.csv files) are also included with this script in order
# to re-run the analyses. Do not forget to change the working directory where
# you saved the .csv data files using the function setwd() for the script to work
# Data files: "2020-06 - 22rivers_HT_final.csv"
#             "2020-06 - 22rivers_LT_final.csv"
#             "2019 - Species red list.csv"
#             "2020-06 - 22rivers_Mouth_Env_data.csv"
# R version 4.0.4 (2021-04-05)
